AutoML

The difference between AutoML and Meta-Learning is that AutoML usually deals with problem itself, while Meta-learning borrows training information from one task to improve a futuer task.

symbolism (behaviourism) and connectionism (cognitism). Symbol grounding means finding the intrinsic meaning of symbols from our first language or connecting to the world in the right way [[1]](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/harnad90_sgproblem.pdf). However, the dynamic patterns in the activations of connections in a multi-layerd nodes are hardly symbols. 



Symbols. invariant feature that discriminate and identify them. Compository, symbols can be combined and recombined rulefully to form higher-order grounded symbols.  One formal test: is it a symbol system? One behavioral test: can it discriminate, identify, and describe what the symbol refer?

connectionism. Ground learning, but not composible.

Brains are agnostic to the type of genomes constructing them and the world which evaluates them. While this may seem like a limitation, consider that the fundamental cognitive elements of biological brains almost certainly have no direct mapping to the meaning of what is being processed (sometimes referred to as the [grounding problem](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/harnad90_sgproblem.pdf)). As a result of this independence, any brain which is constructed from a genome can be constructed using any type of genome and any brain can be used in any world.

Worlds interact with brains by a) programming brain inputs based on the world state, b) calling a brain update, c)
reading the brainâ€™s output, and then d) updating the state of the world.

In prisoner's dilemma, it requires brains with fixed strategies, which in turn requires brains that have information about the worlds in which they are running. We have previously stated that, in general, brains do not have information about the worlds in which they are running, but if the meanings of the inputs and outputs that a brain will receive and deliver are known, a brain can be designed to make use of this knowledge.

Markov brain has more capability when dealing with discrete perceptions than typicla neural networks, because it is equipped with a lookup table for processing.
