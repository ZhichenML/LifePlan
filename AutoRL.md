- [ ] [Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01569.pdf): The strategy to generate the network, or network generator stated in the paper, introduce prior bias to the generated network and limit the network search space to a subspce. To circumvent the prior bias, this paper tries to explot random graphs as network generator and transform the graph into neural networks. The node operation is predifined and universal. It is similar to our idea of letting the network emerge itself, rather than pre-define any network types.
