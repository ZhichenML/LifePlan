### Interpretable Decision Making by inductic logic

#### Problem definition: 

Off-policy RL usually samples data from memory buffer to improve the policy. Due to uncontrollable data sampling, this regime is generally inefficient. We ask if we could synthesis the logic from the past experience and use that abstraction to guide the update of the policy.
