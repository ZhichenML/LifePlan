I am going to state my research proposal here.

In this fast evolving world, machine learning is to find knowledge from enormous data.

My research has several concerns:

1. The representation of complex or structured data, such as sequences, videos etc. by means of manifold, model space etc.
2. The distance measurement for data or data representations, especially for difficult data, e.g. imbalanced.
3. The employment of valuable label information where only a few samples are labeled, e.g. semi-supervised learning.
