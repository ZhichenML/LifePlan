# Concave-Pareto-Front
This manuscript is to analyze what will happen when the Pareto front is non-convex. In particular, we want to know if linear combination can approximate the Pareto front, and why/ why not. Note that by adjusting the exponential parameter of function h, we are able to geneerate convex or non-convex pareto front for further analysis.

* Conclusion: weighted aggregation cannot find solutions on the concave Pareto front.

The two conflicting objectives are from the following paper:
